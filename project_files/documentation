My program is supposed to be satire but it sounded more serious than I thought so I went for a more serious route to it. 
The first idea was inspired by my favorite video game Fallout and throughout the final result the game still had some influence. 
My program is an online delivery of goods that are advertised as products for the apocalypse. 
The program includes the products which consist of flashlights, thermal water bottles, thermal food containers, non-perishable packages, and med-kits. 
It originally had items from Fallout, like weapons and healing items from the game, however, that was before I decided to change gears. 
The target audience I originally wanted to say was for those who were a fan of the franchise. 
However because I changed my mind, the target audience are for those who want to be prepared for the apocalypse and those who are in need of such items (usually those in unfortunate disasters/events).

If there was something that I was confident about in my program it would be my whole process for the products and by that I mean the arrays, the product handling, and the outputs are to my liking. 
I’m also confident about my buttons, they all seem to direct the users to what they were designed to do. 

As for weakness, I’m afraid that I am a woman of repetition. I feel that I made the program harder than it needed to be. 
I was also disappointed that I didn’t get to figure out how to use JDatePicker. 
Another weakness I know I haven’t overcome is the real validation of the delivery time and date; the user can input any date as long as it's within the format which isn’t very ideal and same goes for time. 
I also have not figured out how to validate the user’s email.

There is a lot to improve but assuming that I get a decent grade and I’m not under the stress of a deadline, I might change it back to what it was originally supposed to be, or maybe just use this program as a reference/inspiration.
